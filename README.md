# Library Management System

## Overview
The Library Management System is a Python-based application designed to simplify the management of a library's operations, including handling books and users, facilitating book checkouts and returns, and maintaining the availability status of books. It leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure the system is scalable, maintainable, and extensible.

## Features
- **Book Management**: Add, update, delete, and list books; search by title, author, or ISBN.
- **User Management**: Add, update, delete, and list users; search by name or user ID.
- **Transaction Handling**: Support for checking books in and out.
- **Logging**: Basic logging of system operations for auditing and troubleshooting.
- **Extensibility**: Designed with future expansion in mind, such as adding new item types or features like due dates and late fees.
